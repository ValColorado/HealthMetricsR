\description{
BMR is the estimated amount of energy the body burns at rest to maintain normal bodily functions such as breathing, digestion, and heart rate.
BMR is often used as a starting point for determining a person’s total daily energy expenditure, which takes into account a person’s physical activity level in addition to their BMR.
